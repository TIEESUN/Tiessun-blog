title: "Spear-Phishing campaigns: Link Vulnerability leads to phishing attacks,
  Spear-Phishing electronic/UAV communication-scam targeted"
abstract: In this paper we have studied and found up to date approaches to spear
  phishing attacks and their preventative measures. The paper also demonstrates
  the steps to set up and run successful phishing campaign and the results
  astonishingly shows that even only personality-targeted messaging can alter
  the response to phishing attacks. As a result of learning the facts, the paper
  suggests that users should seek to improve their security awareness by
  becoming familiar with the warning signs of phishing attacks. Moreover, more
  often in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) or drones (which are now being used in
  various domains including military operations, monitoring, etc.), the
  resources are deployed as web services which makes them vulnerable to phishing
  activities. A data mining technique is also suggested as a tool for the
  detection of phishing attacks in UAVs.
