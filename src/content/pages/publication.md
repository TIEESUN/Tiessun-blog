title: Securing Medical Datasets using Block Chain Technology
abstract: Medical data sets are crucial in modern healthcare as they provide valuable information that helps in advancing medical research, improving patient care, and making informed decisions. They allow healthcare providers to track patient health records, evaluate treatments and outcomes, and identify trends and patterns in disease diagnosis and management. Additionally, medical data sets are used for training AI models that can assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing and treating diseases, providing accurate and timely patient care, and reducing medical errors.
In recent years millions of patient records have already been compromised due to data thefts in the healthcare industry ranging from patientâ€™s private health data to hospitals accounting, reporting, DNA structures etc.  are all being taken. Blockchain technology, which is regarded as a trustworthy way to maintain documents, could be utilized to protect full security and confidentiality. This approach would not only safeguard patient data but also due to decentralized structure of a technology it also lead to more efficient treatment of patients as information would be readily and instantly available. Therefore, proper implementation of the blockchain system will not only increase individual service but also remove the need for external parties to provide security.
The study proposed a model that would unites almost all of the leading healthcare providers, by combining all Electronic Health Record (EHR) system including hospitals, clinics, and specialized Laboratories as well. MedBloc, a blockchain-based safe EHR system that offers accessibility, safety, and protection is described. It allows both patients and healthcare professionals to view and exchange medical records, by extracting important ideas that can be used to create multiple blockchain systems and vulnerability scanning that address security flaws. This article also presents blockchain vulnerability management options by analyzing some assaults upon blockchain, including hashing, connectivity, smart contract and privacy breach cyberattacks. It has been proven difficult as a result of trustworthy attack analysis techniques. Therefore, we explore the blockchain's user privacy in this paper and consider potential fixes. We systematically divide the three kinds of blockchain attack strategies, then mentioned the associated attack and defense techniques that rely on such divisions.
