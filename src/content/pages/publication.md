title: Securing Medical Datasets using Blockchain Technology
abstract: The study proposed a model that would unites almost all of the leading healthcare providers, by combining all Electronic Health Record (EHR) system including hospitals, clinics, and specialized Laboratories as well. MedBloc, a blockchain-based safe EHR system that offers accessibility, safety, and protection is described. It allows both patients and healthcare professionals to view and exchange medical records, by extracting important ideas that can be used to create multiple blockchain systems and vulnerability scanning that address security flaws. This article also presents blockchain vulnerability management options by analyzing some assaults upon blockchain, including hashing, connectivity, smart contract and privacy breach cyberattacks. It has been proven difficult as a result of trustworthy attack analysis techniques. Therefore, we explore the blockchain's user privacy in this paper and consider potential fixes. We systematically divide the three kinds of blockchain attack strategies, then mentioned the associated attack and defense techniques that rely on such divisions.
