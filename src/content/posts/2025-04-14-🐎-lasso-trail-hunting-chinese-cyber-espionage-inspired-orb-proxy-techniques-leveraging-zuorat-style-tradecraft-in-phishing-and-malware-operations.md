## üìù**Executive Summary**

**ZuoRAT** is a Chinese-linked Remote Access Trojan (RAT) targeting SOHO routers to perform internal network surveillance and compromise LAN-connected devices. What makes it distinct is its use of an **ORB-style proxy C2 network**, where **compromised routers or cloud nodes act as relays**, hiding the attacker‚Äôs real infrastructure.

These **ORB (Obfuscated Relay Backend) nodes** often return decoy **404 pages**, use **keyboard-walk certs** (e.g., `defasd`), and support **multiple malicious operations**, including **phishing, malware delivery, and C2 tunneling**.

The **HOKAGE-COWBOYS** operation uncovers a **multi-purpose ORB-based proxy network** actively used by Chinese-speaking threat actors to **blend phishing and malware ops**, evade attribution, and scale access across regions. This report documents the infrastructure, behaviors, and indicators uncovered during the hunt.

## üß± **Infrastructure Overview**

### Overview of ORB-Style Infrastructure

During our operation, **HOKAGE-COWBOYS** identified multiple IP addresses exhibiting hallmarks of an **ORB-based proxy network** ‚Äî an infrastructure technique previously associated with campaigns like ZuoRAT. These nodes leverage **stealth-layered communication relays**, typically fronted by benign-looking HTTP servers returning either **generic 200 OK** or **404 Not Found** responses, depending on the probe context.

### Common Traits Across Observed Infrastructure:

* Use of **self-signed TLS certificates** with junk/common name fields like **defasd** (keyboard-walk pattern).
* **Consistent issuer and subject details**, indicating likely use of a scripted C2 builder or panel.
* **Diverse HTTP behaviors** across endpoints ‚Äî from full `200 OK` responses to intentional `404 Not Found`, indicating selective exposure or **conditional logic**.
* All infrastructure uses **TLS 1.2** with SHA256-RSA certs, and contains **anomalous fields** (e.g., `Province: NERr`, `Email: sdf`, etc.) ‚Äî not consistent with legitimate use.
* Hosted on **ASNs with historical abuse footprints**, including:

  * **Shinjiru Technology (AS45839)** ‚Äì known bulletproof hosting provider.
  * Hosting IPs in **Malaysia**, correlating with infrastructure patterns seen in other ORB-style C2 networks.

### üìé Certificate Details (Consistent Across All 3):

* **CommonName:** `defasd`
* **Issuer / Subject Org:** `vf / asde`
* **Valid:** 2020‚Äì2030 (suspiciously long lifespan)
* **Self-signed:** Yes
* **Junk metadata fields:** e.g., `Province: NERr`, `Email: sdf`

These shared certificates are strong evidence of a **custom-generated C2 cert template**, reused across nodes for both malware staging and phishing functions.



The presence of uniform certificates, mixed HTTP behavior, and hosting within **Shinjiru‚Äôs infrastructure** strongly suggests that these endpoints are part of a multi-node ORB-style proxy network. Their job is to relay malicious payloads, handle stolen credentials, or serve as C2 relays all while maintaining plausible deniability via decoy responses and fake certificates.
